#Maumasi's Awesome URL Shortener!


Open your terminal if you're on a Unix or Linus machine if you're not already after doing the pull request. </br>
Install all the **dependancies** and **dev dependancies** for the app with the all important **npm install**:
```bash
$ cd URL_Shortener
$ npm install
```
</br>

To run the node.js server up and running you'll have to navigate to the </br>
server.js file then use the key word node to tell node.js to run the file:
```bash
$  node src/server.js
```
\*\* **Remember, you'll have to re-run this command every time you want to check file changes in the bowser** \*\*
</br>
</br>

If you have nodemon installed( ``` npm i -g nodemon``` ) you can simply use:
```bash
$ nodemon src/server.js
```
Using ``` nodemon ``` will do a live reload for you every time you save a file in the project... *most of the time*.
If you do have to manually reload the server just use the ``` $ rs ``` command to 'restart server'. It's kinda awesome.
