Maumas's Awesome URL Shortener!

After doing a pull request install all the **dependancies** and **dev dependancies** the app with the all important **npm install**:
```bash
$ cd URL_Shortener
$ npm install
```

To run the node.js server you'll have to navigate to the server.js file using the key word node:
```bash
$  node src/server.js
```
\*\* **Remember, you'll have to re-run this command every time you want to check file changes in the bowser** \*\*



If you have nodemon installed( ``` npm i -g nodemon``` ) you can simply use:
```bash
$ nodemon src/server.js
```

Using ``` nodemon ``` will do a live reload for you every time you save a file in the project... *most of the time*.
If you do have to manually reload the server just use the ``` $ rs ``` command. It's kinda awesome.
